== INTERNET DICTATOR

Internet Dictator is a website that will read aloud RSS feeds or submitted articles using your browser's built in text-to-speech engine. Specifically, it uses the HTML5 Web Speech API.

The concept was born out of the previously unfulfillable desire to read articles while walking or driving to work.
